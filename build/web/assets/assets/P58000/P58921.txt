Hosanna
<1>
I see the king of glory 
Coming on the
clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes
Ye-ah
I see His
love and mercy 
Washing over
all our sin
The people sing
The people sing
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
I see a generation 
Rising up to
take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith
I see a near revival 
Stirring as we
pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Heal my heart and
make it clean 
Open up my eyes
to the things unseen
Show me how to love
like You have loved me
Break my heart
from what breaks yours
Everything I am
for Your
kingdoms cause
As I go from
nothing to eternity
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest 
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
