<1>
In this holy place
The people of God come
together for the lord
Come and worship
Him with singing
Give glory to the Lord
All His work
is wonderful
All His way is
truthful indeed
All children of God
Delight with great
joy in our God
Unto the Lamb
Sat on the throne
Oh Praise His
name forever
All the nations
with singing
Give glory to the Lord
Lift Him high
Happily playing with
harp and lyre for Him
Lift up our voice
Sing to Him a new song
Praise the Lord
singing with one voice
Praise the Lord
a new song
All you gathered
people of God
Make the angels
sing Respond
Sing it loud
for all to hear
The Lord our savior
The eyes of all will
see him coming
All the nations
praise mighty God
All bow down
to the ground
in worship
Glorify Him
Unto the Lamb
Sat on the throne
Oh Praise His
name forever
All the nations
with singing
Give glory to the Lord
Lift Him high
Happily playing with
harp and lyre for Him
Lift up our voice
Sing to Him a new song
Praise the Lord
singing with one voice
Praise the Lord
a new song
All you gathered
people of God
Make the angels
sing Respond
Sing it loud
for all to hear
The Lord our savior
The eyes of all will
see him coming
All the nations

All the praise and
glory and wisdom
and thanks
Be to the Lord
Oh throughout
all eternity
Hallelujah
Almighty God reigns
in all the earth
Praise the Lord
