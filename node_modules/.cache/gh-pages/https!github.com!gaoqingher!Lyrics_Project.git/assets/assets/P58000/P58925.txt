I Bless Your name
<1>
I wanna stay
here in this place
Resting in your
everlasting arms
There's nothing
as great as
praising your name
Lifting up the name
of Jesus Christ
As I behold
your wondrous love
I will forever
glorify the King
of Heaven
It's my joy my life
to praise your name
Nothing could
ever separate me
from the love
I've found in You
I bless your name
I wanna stay
here in this place
Resting in your
everlasting arms
There's nothing
as great as
praising your name
Lifting up the name
of Jesus Christ
As I behold
your wondrous love
I will forever
glorify the King
of Heaven
It's my joy my life
to praise your name
Nothing could
ever separate me
from the love
I've found in You
I bless your name
I will forever
glorify the King
of Heaven
It's my joy
my life to praise
your name
Nothing could
ever separate me
from the love
I've found in You
I bless your name
I bless your name
I love your name
