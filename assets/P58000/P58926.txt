I can only imagine
<1>
I can only imagine
What it will be like
When I walk
By Your side
I can only imagine
What my eyes will see
When Your face
Is before me
I can only imagine
Surrounded
by Your glory
what will
my heart feel
Will I dance
for You Jesus
or in awe
of You be still
Will I stand
in Your presence
or to my knees
will I fall
Will I sing
hallelujah
will I be able
to speak at all
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
When that day comes
And I find myself
Standing in the Son
I can only imagine
When all I will do
Is forever
Forever worship You
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
Surrounded
by Your glory
what will
my heart feel
Will I dance
for You Jesus
or in awe
of You be still
Will I stand
in Your presence
or to my knees
will I fall
Will I sing
hallelujah
will I be able
to speak at all
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
Surrounded
by Your glory
what will
my heart feel
Will I dance
for You Jesus
or in awe
of You be still
Will I stand
in Your presence
or to my knees
will I fall
Will I sing
hallelujah
will I be able
to speak at all
I can only imagine
