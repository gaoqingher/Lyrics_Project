I Will Carry You
<1>
There were photographs
I wanted to take
Things I wanted
to show you
Sing sweet lullabies
wipe your teary eyes
Who could love
you like this?
People say that
I am brave
but I'm not
Truth is I'm
barely hanging on
But there's
a greater story
Written long
before me
Because He loves
you like this-
I will carry you
While your heart
beats here
Long beyond
the empty cradle
Through the
coming years
I will carry you
All my life
I will praise
the One Who's
chosen me
To carry you
Such a short time
Such a long road
All this madness
But I know
That the silence
Has brought me
to His voice
And He says
I've shown
her photographs
of time beginning
Walked her through
the parted seas
Angel lullabies
no more teary eyes
Who could love
her like this?
I will carry you
While your heart
beats here
Long beyond
the empty cradle
Through the
coming years
I will carry you
All your life
I will praise the
One Who's chosen Me
To carry you
