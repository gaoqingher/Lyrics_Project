Dwell in your house
<1>
You set me apart
Gave me a new heart
Filled with
compassion
To share
Your great love
Show me your ways
I want to know you
Guide me in truth
My hope is in you
That I may dwell
in your house forever
Lifting up Your name..
Dwell in your
house forever more
That I may dwell
in your house forever 
Lifting up Your name..
Dwell in your
house forever more
I'll hold on to you
My strength
and my refuge
Whom shall I fear
I know You are near
All of my days
I live for you Lord
Establish my path
There's one
thing I ask
That I may dwell
in your house forever
Lifting up Your name..
Dwell in your
house forever more
That I may dwell
in your house forever
Lifting up Your name..
Dwell in your
house forever more
Holy Spirit
have your way
have your way
Sweet anointing
teach our hearts
Our lives we pray
That I may dwell
in your house forever
Lifting up Your name
Dwell in your
house forever more
That I may dwell
in your house forever
Lifting up Your name..
Dwell in your
house forever more
That I may dwell
in your house forever
Lifting up Your name
Dwell in your
house forever more
