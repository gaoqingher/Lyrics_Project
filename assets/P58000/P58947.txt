What a faithful God have I
<1>
Ooh Lord I come before
Your throne of grace
I find rest
in your presence
And fullness of joy
In worship and wonder
I behold Your face
Singing what
a faithful God have I
What a faithful
God have I
you are
What a faithful God
What a faithful
God have I
you are faithful
in every way
Lord I come before
your throne of grace
I find rest
in your presence
And fullness of joy
In worship and wonder
I behold your face
Singing what
a faithful God have I
oh what a faithful
God have I
What a faithful God
What a faithful
God have I
you are faithful
in every way
Ooh Lord of mercy
you have heard my cry
Through the storm
You're the beacon
My song in the night
In the shelter
of your wings
Hear my heart's reply
Singing what a faithful
God have I--
oh what a faithful
God have I
you are
What a faithful God
What a faithful
God have I
you are faithful
in every way
Lord all sov'rign
Granting peace
from heaven
Let me comfort
those who suffer
With the comfort
You have give
and I will tell
of your great love
For as long as I live
Singing what
a faithful God have I
oh what a faithful
God have I
faithful in the morning
What a faithful God
faithful through
the night
What a faithful
God have I
you are faithful
in every way
oh what a faithful
God have I
What a faithful God
What a faithful
God have I
your faithful
in every way
Faithful God
