God will make a way
<1>
God will make a way
Where there seems
to be no way
He works in ways
we cannot see
He will make a way
for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely
to his side
With love
and strength
for each new day
He will make a way
He will make a way
God will make a way
Where there seems
to be no way
He works in ways
we cannot see
He will make a way
for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely
to his side
With love
and strength
for each new day
He will make a way
He will make a way
By a roadway
in the wilderness
He'll lead me
rivers in the desert
will I see
Heaven and earth
will fade
But his Word
will still remain
He will do
something new today
God will make a way
Where there
seems to be no way
He works in ways
we cannot see
He will make a way
for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely
to his side
With love
and strength
for each new day
He will make a way
He will make a way
<2>
God will make a way
Where there
seems to be no way
He works in ways
we cannot see
He will make a way
for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely
to his side
With love
and strength
for each new day
He will make a way
He will make a way
With love
and strength
for each new day
He will make a way
He will make a way
