The Mission
<1>
Here's a call
going out across
the land
in every nation
a call to all who swear
allegiance to the cross
of Christ
a call to true 
humility
to live our lives
responsibly
to deepen our devotion
to the cross
at any price
let us then be sober
moving only
in the spirit
as aliens and strangers
in a hostile
foreign land
the message
we're proclaiming
is repentance
and forgiveness
the offer of salvation
to the dying
race of man
to love the Lord
our God
is the heartbeat
of our mission
the spring
from which our
service overflows
across the street
or around the world
the mission's
still the same
proclaim and live
the truth
in Jesus name
as a candle
is consumed
by the passion
of the flame
spilling light
unsparingly
throughout
the darkened room
let us burn
to know him deeper
then our service
flaming bright
will radiate
his passions and blaze
with holy light
to love the Lord
our God
is the heartbeat
of our mission
the spring
from which our
service overflows
across the street
or around the world
the mission's
still the same
proclaim and live
the truth
in Jesus name
to love the Lord
our God
is the heartbeat
of our mission
the spring
from which our
service overflows
across the street
or around the world
the mission's
still the same
proclaim and live
the truth
in Jesus name
the spring
from which our
service overflows
across the street
or around the world
the mission's
