Father of creation
<1>
We come
into your presence
To sing
a song to you
A song
of praise
and honour
For all the things
you helped
us through
You gave a life
worth living
A life in love
with you
And now I just
love giving
All my praises
back to you
You're the Father
of Creation
The risen
Lamb of God
You're the one
who walked away
From the empty
tomb that day
And you set
your people free
With love
and liberty
And I can walk
with you
Every night
and every day
You're the Father
of Creation
The risen
Lamb of God
You're the one
who walked away
From the empty
tomb that day
And you set
your people free
With love
and liberty
And I can walk
with you
Every night
and every day
We come
into your presence
To sing
a song to You
A song
of praise
and honour
For all the things
you helped
us through
You gave a life
worth living
A life in love
with you
And now I just
love giving
All my praises
back to you
You're the Father
of Creation
The risen
Lamb of God
You're the one
who walked away
From the empty
tomb that day
And you set
your people free
With love
and liberty
And I can walk
with you
Every night
and every day
You're the Father
of Creation
The risen
Lamb of God
You're the one

From the empty

And you set
