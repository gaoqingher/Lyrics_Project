When the power
of darkness
comes in
like a flood
The battle
belongs to the Lord
He's raised up
a standard
the power
of his blood
The battle
belongs to the Lord 
And we sing glory
honor power
and strength
to the Lord
We sing glory
honor Power
and strength
to the Lord

When your
enemy presses in
hard do not fear
The battle belongs
to the Lord

is near
