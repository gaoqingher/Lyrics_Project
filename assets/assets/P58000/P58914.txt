Give me that slow knowing smile
<1>
I'm on my hands
and knees
searching every corner
for my lost
heart and soul
now hear me
begging please
I'm searching
every corner
for my lost
heart and soul
Give me that
Slow knowing smile
Like someone who may
know their way
Give me that
Slow knowing smile
That may make me
wanna say
hey hey hey hey hey
Give me that
Slow knowing smile
Give it to me
Slowly
Give me that
Slow knowing smile
Give it to me
Slowly

I tell you what I do
I'm searching
every corner
for what 
I know is mine
I tell you
what is true
My heart and my soul
is what I need to find
Give me that
Slow knowing smile
Like someone who knows
where to go
Give me that
Slow knowing smile
That may make me
wanna say

Give me that
Slow knowing smile
Give it to me
Slowly
Give me that
Slow knowing smile
Give it to me
