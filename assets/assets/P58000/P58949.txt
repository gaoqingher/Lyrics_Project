You are the life
<1>
To You O Lord
I lift up my soul
In You I trust--
O my God-
No one whose- hope--
is in You-
Will ever-- be--
put to shame
You are the Life
You are the Good
You are the
very Breath in me
You are the Way
You are the Truth
You are the
only Hope I see
You never let me
fall too far
I cannot go
beyond Your grasp-
Your hand is there
to hold me tight
If I will only ask-
Cause you are
the life---
you are the life---
My soul it yearns
even faints
For- the courts
of You my God
My heart and flesh
both cry out
Cry out for
You the living God
You are the Life
You are the Good
You are the very
Breath in me
You are the Way
You are the Truth
You are the
only Hope I see
You never let
me fall too far
I cannot go
beyond Your grasp-
Your hand is there
to hold me tight
If I will only ask-
You are the Life
You are the Good
You are the very
Breath in me
You are the Way
You are the Truth
You are the
only Hope I see
You never let
me fall too far
I cannot go
beyond Your grasp-
Your hand is there
to hold me tight
If I will only ask-
You are the life---
You are the life---
You are the life--
a-a-ah
You are the life
a-a-ah
